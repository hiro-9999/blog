You can create native apps with native performance and native controls (real native controls, not native-looking copies) using the same ideas of building components and UIs. It’s not about “write once, run everywhere” (our industry keeps failing at this), it’s about “learn once, use everywhere.”
To cut a long story short: learn React, take 80% of your time back, and focus on the stuff that matters (like the real reason your app exists).
