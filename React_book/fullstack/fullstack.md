SSR: Essentially serves documents with all the components rendered and populated with necessary data (from APIs). This way a bot can see all the info without the need for JavaScript execution. This makes serving pages with no real-time updates like Blogs, Profile data etc simple and allows for good SEO.
SSG: It serves purely static pages (No API data), and offers good SEO at the same time. Useful for things like documentation.
ISR: Itâ€™s like SSR but it periodically refreshes the static Pages with new API data. Useful for things like blogs and profiles where updates may not be frequent but do happen and must be reflected.
