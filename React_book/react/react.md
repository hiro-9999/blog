The React team primarily recommends these solutions:
If you’re learning React or creating a new single-page app, use Create React App.
If you’re building a server-rendered website with Node.js, try Next.js.
If you’re building a static content-oriented website, try Gatsby.
If you’re building a component library or integrating with an existing codebase, try More Flexible Toolchains.
