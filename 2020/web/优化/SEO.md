Here is an article about best practice for video SEO from google itself:

Seems we are not doing this from best practice:
Google must be able to find the video. Videos are identified in the page by the presence of an HTML tag, for example: <video>, <embed>, or <object>. Ensure that the page doesnâ€™t require complex user actions or specific URL fragments to load, or Google might not find it. Tip: Although we can find videos embedded in a page through natural crawling, you can help us find your videos by posting a video sitemap.
You must provide a high-quality thumbnail image for the video.
Provide structured data, a video sitemap, or both, describing your video. Structured data is best when Google already knows about the page; a sitemap is good for helping Google find new content or learn about new or changed content. Some sites use both: on-page structured data for all videos plus a video sitemap to tell Google about any new, time-sensitive, or hard-to-find videos.
