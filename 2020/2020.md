https://medium.com/better-programming/10-things-front-end-developers-should-learn-in-2020-61b448e75483
Some things a clean-code developer should do are:
Create meaningful names for variables, classes, methods, and functions
Functions should be small and have as few arguments as possible
Comments shouldn’t be required at all — the code should speak for itself


One can differentiate between test cases like:
Unit tests
Testing a single component or function in isolation.
Integration tests
Testing interactions between components.
End-to-end test
Testing full-blown user flows in the browser.
