int theVariable = 5;
int *pPointer = &theVariable;
pPointer = 0x00007ffeefbffda8  // a Pointer 是个地址

 *pPointer = 5 // point 指向一个数值
 
   unsigned short int myAge = 5, yourAge = 10;
    unsigned short int *pAge = &myAge; // a pointer
    
    pAge = &myAge; 

    pAge = &yourAge; // reassign the pointer
