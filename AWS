  EC2 instances come in a range of sizes, referred to as instance types, to suit various use cases.
  The instance types differ wildly in the amount of resources allocated to them.
  The m3.medium instance type has 3.75 GB of memory and 1 virtual CPU core, whereas its significantly bigger brother c3.8xlarge has 60 GB of memory and 32 virtual CPU cores. 
  Each virtual CPU is a hyperthread of an Intel Xeon core in the m3 and c3 instance classes.
