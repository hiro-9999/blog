```
The 3 pillars for the future of apps
Declarative UIs (JetpackCompose on Android, SwiftUI on iOS)
KMP (Kotlin MultiPlatform)
MVI pattern (Model-View-Intent)

We call this architecture D-KMP, standing for DeclarativeUIs with Kotlin MultiPlatform. The MVI pattern is what makes the two work best together.
```


KMM = Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (just Android and iOS)

KMP = Kotlin MultiPlatform (also includes Desktop and Web)

# In KMP, the shared code is written in Kotlin, but itâ€™s compiled as a native library: a Jar file for Android, an ObjectiveC framework for iOS, a JS library for the web. For this reason, the native UI layer can talk to the shared code in the most natural way, on each platforms.
