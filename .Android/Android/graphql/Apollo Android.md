# Apollo Android
https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android

Apollo Android is a GraphQL client that generates Java and Kotlin models from GraphQL queries. These models give you a type-safe API to work with GraphQL servers. Apollo helps you keep your GraphQL query statements together, organized, and easy to access.

This library is designed primarily with Android in mind, but you can use it in any Java/Kotlin app.
