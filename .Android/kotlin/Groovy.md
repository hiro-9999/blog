# Groovy 1.4

### Functional programming (FP) is a programming style that focuses
on functions and minimizes changes of state (using immutable data structures). It is closer to expressing solutions mathematically, rather than through step-by-step instructions.

## A domain-specific language (DSL) is a custom programming language made for a specific domain. For example, you can think of HTML as a DSL for displaying web pages.
Some languages allow you such freedom that you can create a DSL inside the language. For example, Groovy and Scala allow you to override the math symbols (+, -, etc.). The other freedoms of these languages (optional parentheses and semicolons) allow for DSL-like interfaces. We call these DSL-like interfaces fluent interfaces.
You can also create fluent interfaces in Java and other languages. The following sections discuss building a DSL with Groovy.

# Java Groovy Scala
In Java, the compiler is called javac; in Groovy it is groovyc; and it is scalac in Scala (see a trend here?). All three of these languages can be compiled to bytecode and run on the JVM.
