```
• Mockito and mockito-kotlin, which help mainly in unit tests and are useful for creating mocks or test double in which we can manipulate inputs so that we can assert different scenarios. (A mock or test double is an object that mimics the implementation of another object. Every time a test interacts with mocks, you can specify the behavior of these interactions.)

• Robolectric, an open source library that brings the Android framework onto your machine, allowing you to test activities and fragments locally and not on the emulator. This can be used for both unit tests and integration tests.

• Espresso, which allows developers to create interactions (clicking buttons, inserting text in EditText components, and so on) and assertions (verifying that views display certain text, are currently being displayed to the user, are enabled, and so on) on an app's UI in an instrumented test.
