# Redux pure functions
to bring consistency and predictability to the data in applications

The store holds all your application state in a single object. (Weâ€™ll commonly refer to this object as the state tree.)
The store can be updated only with actions, an object describing an event.
Functions known as reducers specify how to transform application state. 
Reducers are functions that take the current state in the store and an action, then return the next state after applying any updates.
