# Explore HTML and CSS

# https://cssreference.io
While we've covered 90% of what you will need to build webpages with HTML and CSS, there are other tags and features available. You can find them on the Mozilla Developer Network. If you want a simpler version, try the free resources I've built: HTML Reference and CSS Reference.
# Learn Sass
https://sass-lang.com

Sass is a CSS preprocessor that allows you to write CSS more easily. It comes with lots of features, but most notably variables (for setting values like colors, sizes, durations...), mixins (like JS functions but for your CSS) or extends (share declarations by extending another selector). You can read my free MarkSheet chapter on Sass as a start.
# Learn JavaScript
https://eloquentjavascript.net

While we've covered a bit of JS, there is a lot more to learn. There are tons of free resources online, like Eloquent JavaScript, JavaScript Garden or Codecademy.
For more complex interfaces, you can use a JS framework like React, AngularJS, Ember.js or Vue.js.
# Learn backend development
https://www.codecademy.com
We've only covered client-side development (or "frontend"). But for more complex websites, you will need to learn server-side development (or "backend"). This requires learning a programming language (like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP...). Again, Codecademy is a great free resource.

Based on the knowledge gathered through 10 years of experience, I've created an open source CSS framework called Bulma.
