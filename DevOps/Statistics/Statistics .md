SQL
The first time I took a SQL TPS I failed, and it was with a company in which I was very interested. Clearly, something needed to change. I needed to, once again, practice, and so I spent time grinding SQL questions. Eventually, I was able to complete in a day, questions that had previously taken me an entire week. Practice makes perfect!
Resources:
Leetcode database problems
HackRank SQL problems
Statistics and Probability
To prepare for these kinds of questions, I brushed up on elementary statistics and probability and did some coding exercises. While this may seem overwhelming (there is a lot of content for both topics), the interview questions for a product data scientist were never hard. The resources below are a great way to review.
Resources:
Khan Academy has an introductory Statistics and Probability course which covers the very basics of both.
This Online Stat Book covers all the basic statistical inference.
Harvard has a Statistics 110: Probability course which is an introductory course on probability with practical problems. If you prefer reading than listening, PennState has an Introduction to Probability Theory course with many examples.
I also coded through 10 days of statistics on HackRank to solidify my understanding.
Sometimes, A/B testing questions were asked during a stats interview. Udacity has a great course to cover the basics of A/B testing and Exp Platform has a more concise tutorial on the topic.

Machine Learning
Without a CS degree, I went into the job search with limited machine knowledge. I had taken some courses during my previous job, and I reviewed my notes from these to prep for interviews. However, even though modeling questions are getting more and more frequent nowadays, the interview questions for a product data scientist mainly geared toward how to apply those models rather than the underlying math and theories. Still here are some helpful resources to bump up your machine learning skills before the interview time.
