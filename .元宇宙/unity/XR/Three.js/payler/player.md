implement basic controls for the 360 video player

If you want VR controls that are inside the 3D space, you either need to create some Plane meshes yourself and move them around to keep them in view, or yep, you can use a library that already does that (a-frame, ReactVR).

If you just want static UI on top of the 3D scene (f.e. full screen and VR buttons) you can just overlay basic HTML stuff (<div>, <a>, <button>, etc) on top of the canvas element (the one Three renders to).
